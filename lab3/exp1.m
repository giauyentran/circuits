%% Experiment 1
figure(1)
% collector current and base current as a function of base voltage along 
% with appropriate theoretical fits and extracted parameter values

figure(2)
% Plot the current gain, Î², which is defined as the ratio of the collector
% current to the base current, as a function of the base current (you 
% should make the base-current-axis log- aritmic for this plot)

figure (3)
% make a log-log plot of rb versus Ib along with an appropriate 
% theoretical fit

figure(4)
% Make a log-log plot of gm versus Ic along with an appropriate 
% theoretical fit.
